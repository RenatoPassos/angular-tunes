[Demo](https://angular-itues.netlify.com/)

This is angular 6 project to fetch songs from free iTuens api, you could also serch and play any song within browser.

Search, Play, Listen and Enjoy!!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Pfft. There are no tests. But if you really want to, you can run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). But there are none so don't waste your time.

## Running end-to-end tests

There aren't any of these either. What am I, a QA department? Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`. Then realize there are no tests and that's 33 seconds of your life you are never getting back.
